Sketches, Practice, Training. Whatever you may call it code that is never intended to be used in a program and are called sketches (At least that's what I call them.)
every piece of code that I practiced on or worked on to figure something out eventually ended up in the Scrap Yard Sketches repository to be collected and scraped away
and can be recycled to make new ideas and what not! Bit & Bobs, Screw's & Bolt's, Code with mechanical wiring and Blinking LED's from the thrown away practice. In a way this
repository is very dear to me because in order to get good at programming you must fail and fail over and over again to achieve success. Dig through the Scrap Yard and maybe you
might learn something new and gain some knowledge.
